### üí° The Motivation (Why?)

Access to high-quality, understandable scientific news in Persian is limited. The goal of this project is to use the power of AI to bridge that gap, making complex topics engaging and accessible to everyone, regardless of their scientific background.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer & Ethical Use

This project is for educational and non-commercial purposes only. The automation is designed to be a "good internet citizen":
-   **Low Frequency:** It runs only once every few hours to avoid putting any strain on the source websites' servers.
-   **Transparency:** This source code is public to show exactly how it operates.
-   **Attribution:** Every post clearly links back to and credits the original source article.
